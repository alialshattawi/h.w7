var a = 10;
var b = -10;
var c = 5;
var d = -12;
var e = 9;

  - if A is even, I would like to print "BLUE"
  if (a % 2 === 0) {
  }
  console.log("blue")
  

  - if B is even, and C is bigger than 5, then I would like to print "GREEN"
  if (b % 2 ===0 && c > 5){
  }
  console.log ("green"){
  
- if B is even, but C is less than 5, I would like then to check if E is odd then print "YELLOW"
  if (b % 2=== 0 ||  c > 5   (e % 2 !=1){
  }
  console.log ("yellow")
  
 - if A is even AND B is even, but C is a negative number, then print "ORANGE"
 (a % === 0 && b % =0 ) || c > 0 {
 }
 console.log("orang")
  
 - if C + D + E is bigger than A + C then print "PURPLE"
 c && b && e > a && c {
 }
 console ("purple")

  - if I've already printed two colors, and C is odd or C is less than B, then print "RED"
  c%2=1 or c<b print red
